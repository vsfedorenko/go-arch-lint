# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- CI workflow with GitHub Actions (build, test, lint).
- Self-lint job in CI: `go run ./cmd/arch-lint check` verifies the project's
  own architecture on every push and PR.
- Community health files: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue and PR templates.
- PlantUML and Mermaid graph output formats.
- Programmatic entry points `archlint.Run` / `archlint.MustRun` with `CheckOptions`.
- `SpecDef` type and `MergeSpecs` for multi-spec support.
- Examples directory with architecture pattern demos.
- Initial `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Delegation model audit: `docs/delegation.md` documents flag routing,
  exit-code survival through `go run`, cache costs (cold ~45 s / steady ~2 s),
  and every system failure mode.

### Changed
- Module renamed to fork `github.com/vsfedorenko/go-arch-lint`.
- DSL spec builder and context handling simplified.
- Scaffold now generates a single `main.go` using `Spec(...)` + `MustRun(spec)`.
- Project config migrated from YAML to Go DSL.
- Container path flattened and shared app bootstrap extracted.
- Replaced `sort.Slice` with the stdlib `slices` package.

### Fixed
- DeepScan concurrency: `workersCount()` now scales with `runtime.NumCPU()`
  (capped at 8) instead of hard-coding a single worker. Result appends are
  protected by a dedicated mutex so concurrent component scanning is safe.
- Scanner no longer descends into excluded directories (fixes permission-denied
  errors on root-owned local volumes).
- Broken import path in `scanner_test.go` (`fe3dback` → `vsfedorenko`).
- Docker image links and goreleaser main package path.
- Various `golangci-lint` warnings resolved.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- Go DSL configuration format with single-file scaffold.
- Graph rendering (d2) and code highlighting (chroma).
- Integration test suite.
